Hi I'm Julia (jballas)
I'm a writer and digital media artist.
When I'm not busy writing novels, I'm experimeting on new coding project and svg animation. One thing my projects have in common is backstory. I always imagine the backstory of whatever I'm drawing, creating or coding. Reach out if you want to collaborate!
